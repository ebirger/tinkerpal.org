Especially when there are already several for MCUs.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, using JavaScript to program MCUs is quite awesome, and doing it on different MCUs, with all the constraints imposed by limited resources, is a fun project to hack.\r\n\r\nPlus, the code base allows a nice starting point for other MCU projects, as it provides utility features such as:\r\n\r\n* Hardware independent peripheral access API\r\n* Timers\r\n* Memory management\r\n* Build/Configuration infrastructure\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* Somewhat functional\r\n* Command Line Interface\r\n* Modules Support\r\n* Portable C99 Source Code\r\n\r\nSource Code\r\n-----------\r\nThe full source code can be found on GitHub (BSD license)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
